**Classes:**

*CS 106B: Programming Abstractions*

*SYMSYS 1: Minds and Machines ❤️* — We covered cogsci concepts from lots of cool perspectives (CS / AI, philosophy, developmental psych, linguistics, and more). Before starting at Stanford, I was under the impression that SymSys is "built around CS". This class made me realize it can be built around anything you want!

*POLI 150A: Data Sci for Politics*

*POLI 52K: Tech and the 2020 Election* — I got to watch Coded Bias because I was on a mailing list related to this class! On the other hand, I think this class would've benefited from a more diverse array of speakers :/

*HUMRTS 194: Environmental Justice Colloquium*

**Other Stuff:**

*The Daily, Rewired* — Helped out with some coding and podcasting
